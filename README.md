# BorderCraft
Pack on a bit of a hiatus. Been getting back to actually playing modpacks instead of developing. You'll know when it's back.

DISCLAIMER:

THERE IS NO BORDERLANDS MOD IN THIS! ALL IT HAS IS SIMILARITIES!

The Story Behind The Pack

This was a shower thought of mine one day and a couple days later I decided to make it a real thing. Started playing it and ended constantly having a full inventory. Started a new world and tried playing through it smart and got to experience something very enjoyable. Before long I had amassed a large arsenal of both Techguns weapons and Team Fortress 2 weapons, a collection of machines, several enchanted books, hundreds of levels of experience, and fun forms of mobility. The pack was a dream come true, or at the very least a thought come true. To this day, however, I still have yet to be able to mow down the Ender Dragon with my arsenal of firearms. 

 

The Content of the Pack

The pack has 175 mods - however most of are of utilitarian nature or are meant to deal with other mods. It has six different performance mods as the pack can get laggy at times. The main bulk of the pack goes to some roleplaying mods as well as gun mods - some examples being The Aether and Flan's Mod. It also features some lesser known mods, such as the challenging Champions, the helpful JAPTA, and the faithful Squake. It provides a couple mods commonly seen in kitchen sinks, but does not aim to be one at all. All of these mods combined are sure to provide a completely new modded experience!
